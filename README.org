* What's this?
  - code completion using libclang for emacs
* Feature
  - executable file hacking in emacs to improve better performance, communicating using dll module not a process, and sending buffer content without string or tempfile, just memory adress.
  - now only surpport code completion, but further may add other practical function from libclang.
  - fast, very fast!
* Note
  - only surpport win32 platform, because of its implementation
* Install
  - download and install vcredist_x86 for vs2008 sp1 from microsoft
  - copy executable files to eamcs bin directory
  - run lcEngineConfig.exe once to hack emacs, this will add lcEngine.dll to emacs import table and gather some other information
  - copy lcEngine.el to load-list path
* Uninstall
  - remove emacs.exe if lcEngineConfig.exe runed successfully, rename emacs.bak.exe to emacs.exe
* coming soon!
